# VISUALIZE SORTING

### Visualize different sorting techniques used in software engineering.

- Choose a `Speed`, `Size`, `Sorting method` and click `RUN`
- After that you have 3 controls viz: `Resume`, `Play`, `Stop`

#### Colors in Canvas (LEGEND)

- `Blue`: Normal
- `Green`: Base Pointer(s)
- `Violet`: Comparing to (can be thought as other pointer)
- `Grey`: Already sorted Elements
- `Orange`: While comparing, some element is found swap worthy. Green Orange are usually swapped.

```js
const colors = {
  pointer: "#0b6623",
  comparing: "#7f00ff",
  normal: "#44a6c6",
  sorted: "#d0d0d0",
  swap: "orange"
};
```
